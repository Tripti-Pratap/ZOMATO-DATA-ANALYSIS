### Introduction
The Zomato Data Analysis project aims to provide insights into various aspects of restaurants listed on Zomato. This includes analyzing the types of restaurants, their ratings, average cost for two people, and the influence of online orders and table bookings on customer satisfaction.

### Dataset
The dataset contains information about restaurants including:
- Restaurant Name
- Restaurant Type
- Rating (out of 5)
- Number of Ratings
- Average Cost for Two People
- Online Order Availability
- Table Booking Availability
- Cuisine Types
- Location and Address

### Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns.
- Create visualizations to effectively communicate findings.
- Derive actionable insights that could help improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Platforms**: Kaggle

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Detailed steps to clean and preprocess the dataset, including:
- Handling missing values.
- Converting data types.
- Removing unnecessary characters from numeric fields.
- Encoding categorical variables if needed.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Conducted EDA to understand the distribution and relationships within the data:
- Distribution of restaurant ratings.
- Analysis of average cost for two people.
- Popular restaurant types.
- Correlation between online orders and ratings.

### Visualizations
Visualizations created using Seaborn and Power BI to highlight key insights:
- Count plot of top 10 restaurant types.
- Distribution of ratings.
- Average cost for two people across different restaurant types.
- Impact of online orders and table bookings on ratings.

### Findings and Insights
Key insights derived from the analysis:
- The top 10 most popular restaurant types.
- Significant correlation between certain restaurant types and higher ratings.
- Trends in average cost for two people.
- Influence of online ordering and table booking availability on customer ratings.

### Power BI Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard has been created to visually present the findings of this analysis. The dashboard includes various charts and graphs that highlight key insights from the dataset.

### Kaggle Notebook
The entire code and analysis are publicly available on Kaggle. You can view and interact with the notebook [[here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/triptipratap/zomato-data-analysis)].
